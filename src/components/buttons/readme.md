# Default 
 
The default button is used to create **highlighted navigation** elements on our website.
It's used for On-Page navigation (scroll to anchor tag), when linking to a different page or even external websites.

Also, this style is used for **formless actions**, such as adding a product to the cart.

# Call To Action

This is a smaller button that is displayed in the **main navigation bar** (which is always visible).

# Form Button

Whenever a **form is submitted**, this button is used - e.g. for login- or contact-forms.
